can be installed by running apt install npm\ngit, can be installed by running apt install git\n\nSetup\nClone repository\nbash\n git clone https://github.com/hisptz/ngx-seed-app.git\nNavigate to application root folder\nbash\ncd ngx-seed-app\nInstall all required dependencies for the app\nbash\nnpm install\nDevelopment server\nTo start development server\nnpm start\nNavigate to http://localhost:4200.\nThis command will require proxy-config.json file available in the root of your source code, usually this file has this format\njson\n{\n  \"/api\": {\n    \"target\": \"https://play.dhis2.org/2.29/\",\n    \"secure\": \"false\",\n    \"auth\": \"admin:district\",\n    \"changeOrigin\": \"true\"\n  },\n  \"/\": {\n    \"target\": \"https://play.dhis2.org/2.29/\",\n

proxy-config.json\nIndex DB Setup\nThis app support index DB as based on dexie library. In order to initiatiate index db then you have to passed index db configuration in forRoot of core module, so in app.module.ts\nts\n........\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...fromPages.pages],\n  imports: [\n   ..........\n    CoreModule.forRoot({\n      namespace: 'hisptz',\n      version: 1,\n      models: {\n        users: 'id',\n        dataElement: 'id',\n        .......\n      }\n    })\n    .......\n    ]\n    ......\n    })\nwhere in the models, for example user will be a table \"user\" and 'id' will be a keyIndex for the table\nBuild\nTo build the project run\nnpm run build\nThe build artifacts will be stored in the dist/, this will include a zip file ready for deploying to any DHIS2 instance.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI
